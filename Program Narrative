# Constant variable for the overtime rate
OT_RATE = 1.25

# Input employee's name

# Input regular hourly pay rate
reg_pay_rate = float(input("Enter regular hourly pay rate: "))

# Calculate overtime hourly pay rate
ot_pay_rate = round(reg_pay_rate * OT_RATE, 2)

# Calculate regular pay
reg_pay = round(reg_hrs * reg_pay_rate, 2)

# Calculate overtime pay
ot_pay = round(ot_hrs * ot_pay_rate, 2)

# Calculate gross pay
gross_pay = reg_pay + ot_pay

# Display employee pay information
