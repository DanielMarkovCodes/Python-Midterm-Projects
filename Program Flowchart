# Program Name: Calculate Gross Pay

# Course Name: Python Programming I

# Define a constant variable for the overtime rate
OT_RATE = 1.25

# Input employee's name
emp_name = input("Enter employee name: ")

# Input regular hours worked
reg_hrs = float(input("Enter regular hours worked: "))

# Input overtime hours worked
ot_hrs = float(input("Enter overtime hours worked: "))

# Input the regular hourly pay rate
reg_pay_rate = float(input("Enter regular hourly pay rate: "))

# Calculate the overtime hourly pay rate
ot_pay_rate = reg_pay_rate * OT_RATE

# Calculate regular pay
reg_pay = round(reg_hrs * reg_pay_rate, 2)

# Calculate overtime pay
ot_pay = round(ot_hrs * ot_pay_rate, 2)

# Calculate gross pay
gross_pay = reg_pay + ot_pay

# Display employee name, regular hours worked, regular hourly pay rate, regular pay, overtime hours worked, overtime hourly pay rate, overtime pay, and gross pay
